This inspection detects duplicate types in Union type annotations.<br>
<code>Union[int, int, str]</code> → <code>Union[int, str]</code><br>
<code>Union[str, str, str]</code> → <code>str</code><br>
<p>
    Having duplicate types in a Union is redundant and reduces code clarity.
    Each type should appear only once in the Union.
