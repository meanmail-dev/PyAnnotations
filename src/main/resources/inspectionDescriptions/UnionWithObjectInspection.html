This inspection reports when the Union[object, ...] annotation was used instead 'object'.<br>
Union[object] -> object<br>
Union[object, int] -> object<br>
Optional[Union[object, string]] -> Optional[object]
<p>
    In Python's type system, 'object' is the base class for all types. When 'object' appears in a Union:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Union becomes equivalent to just 'object' since every type is already a subtype of 'object'</li>
    <li>The other types in the Union become redundant</li>
    <li>The annotation can be simplified for better readability and clarity</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This inspection helps eliminate unnecessary complexity in type annotations.
