This inspection detects TypeVar used in function annotations without meaningful binding.<br>
<code>def foo(x: T) -> int</code> — T is used only once, doesn't constrain anything<br>
<code>def bar(x: T) -> T</code> — T is used meaningfully (input/output relationship)<br>
<p>
    A TypeVar should be used at least twice in a function signature to establish
    a type relationship (e.g., between parameters, or between a parameter and return type).
    Using a TypeVar only once is equivalent to using <code>Any</code> and provides
    no additional type safety.

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> This inspection uses heuristics to detect TypeVars (single uppercase letters,
    names ending with _T, etc.) and may have false positives.
