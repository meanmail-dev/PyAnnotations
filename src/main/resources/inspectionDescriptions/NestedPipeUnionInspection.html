This inspection reports nested pipe unions that can be flattened (Python 3.10+).<br>
<code>(int | str) | float</code> → <code>int | str | float</code><br>
<code>bool | (int | str)</code> → <code>bool | int | str</code><br>
<p>
    Nested pipe unions with parentheses can be flattened into a single union expression.
    This makes the type annotation more readable without changing its meaning.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> The pipe operator <code>|</code> for unions is left-associative, so
    <code>A | B | C</code> is parsed as <code>(A | B) | C</code>. Explicit parentheses
    around inner unions are redundant.
