This inspection reports when Optional is redundantly nested inside another Optional.<br>
Optional[Optional[Type]] -> Optional[Type]<br>
<p>
    Nested Optional types are redundant because Optional already indicates that a value might be None.
    Having multiple layers of Optional doesn't change the semantics - a value is either present or None.
