This inspection reports when the Union[..., Any] annotation was used instead of just 'Any'.<br>
Union[Any] -> Any<br>
Union[Any, int] -> Any<br>
Union[str, Any, float] -> Any<br>
<p>
    Since Any is a supertype of all other types in Python, a Union that includes Any is equivalent to just Any.
    This simplification makes the code more readable and avoids unnecessary complexity.
