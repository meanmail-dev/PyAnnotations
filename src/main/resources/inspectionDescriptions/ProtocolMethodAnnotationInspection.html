This inspection checks that Protocol methods have proper type annotations.<br>
<pre>
class MyProtocol(Protocol):
    def method(self, x) -> int:  # Warning: 'x' should have annotation
        ...

    def other(self, x: int):  # Warning: should have return type
        ...
</pre>
<p>
    Protocol classes define structural subtyping interfaces. For Protocols to work
    correctly with type checkers, all method parameters and return types should
    be annotated. Without annotations, type checkers cannot properly verify
    that implementing classes satisfy the Protocol.
